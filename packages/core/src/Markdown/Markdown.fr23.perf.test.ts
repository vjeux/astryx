 * @file Markdown.fr23.perf.test.ts
 * @input The FR23 benchmark, run as its own process
 * @output The exact `spec:AST-036` FR23 gate against the empty pipeline
 * @position Overhead budget evidence for the canonical plugin protocol
 *
 * The measurement does not run here. This file spawns
 * `Markdown.fr23.bench.ts` as a dedicated Node process, one section size at
 * a time, and only asserts on what that process reports.
 *
 * It has to work that way. The ratio is sensitive to two things a test
 * runner cannot hold still: other Vitest files competing for the machine,
 * and engine state — polymorphic call sites through the parser — left by
 * every other plugin configuration the worker already exercised. The same
 * code measured ~1.17 alone and up to ~1.54 beside the rest of the suite.
 * A fresh process with nothing else in it removes both, so the number the
 * budget is applied to reflects the helpers rather than the scheduler.
 *
 * The timed region inside that process is the spec's protocol, unsmoothed:
 * ten untimed warmups, then one median of nine alternating paired rounds,
 * for a stable plugin list and a recreated equivalent one, against the
 * omitted baseline.
