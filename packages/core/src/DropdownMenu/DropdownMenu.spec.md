# DropdownMenu component contract

## Intent

DropdownMenu presents actions from a visible Button trigger in either an
anchored pointer menu or a BottomSheet-hosted touch action list. This draft
records current consumer anatomy, presentation-specific ownership, and theming
reachability. Its press model — the row under the release acts and the
highlight follows the pointer — is contracted by
`module:DropdownMenu/useMenuPress`, which both presentations mount.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: `yes`
- Compatibility class: additive documentation; the press-model behavior
  delta is recorded in `module:DropdownMenu/useMenuPress`
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: unchanged
- Migration decision: `module:DropdownMenu/useMenuPress/DEC-3`; proposed
  `module:DropdownMenu/useMenuPress/DEC-4`

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- The Pointer menu surface and Touch menu surface and their shared current
  `dropdown-menu` target.
- Pointer action rows, pointer-only section headings and dividers, radio marker
  specialization, and submenu indicator presentation through the other five
  current DropdownMenu targets.
- Selecting between the current pointer and touch render paths after presentation
  policy resolves.
- Mounting the shared press model on both menu surfaces and (proposed) on
  the Trigger button for mouse press-open and held-finger open; the model
  itself is owned by `module:DropdownMenu/useMenuPress`.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- Trigger-button presentation — delegated to `component:Button`.
- The Touch sheet frame — delegated to `component:BottomSheet`.
- Touch action-list and row presentation — delegated to `component:List`.
- Shared checkbox-indicator and ordinary icon presentation — delegated to
  `component:Indicator` and `component:Icon`.
- Shared layer lifecycle or dismissal policy.

## Public concepts

Consumer props, item shapes, subcomponents, and presentation policy remain
documented in `DropdownMenu.doc.mjs` and the subcomponent docs. Three component-local concepts are added, by DEC-2, DEC-3 and DEC-8; each keeps its
released default.

| Concept         | Closed values or states                                  | Meaning                                                                                                                                                               | Availability by variant/orientation/state | Default  | Owner                    | Stability | Invalid-value behavior                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Menu height cap | `menuMaxHeight`: a number of pixels                      | Lifts the 300px cap for a menu that must fit its rows; the viewport still bounds it.                                                                                  | Pointer presentation                      | `300px`  | `component:DropdownMenu` | stable    | Ignored by the touch sheet.                         |
| Trigger source  | `button` (Button props) or `renderTrigger` (render prop) | Which control the menu hangs off. `trigger` receives `DropdownMenuTriggerProps` — the press model, keyboard opens, toggle click and ARIA wiring — and names the menu. | Both presentations                        | `button` | `component:DropdownMenu` | stable    | Both given: `trigger` wins and a dev warning fires. |
| Radio mark      | `indicator` on a radio group: `radio` or `check`         | How a radio group's rows mark the chosen option: the radio circle on every row, or the shared `check` indicator at each row's inline end, in its state.               | Compound radio groups                     | `radio`  | `component:DropdownMenu` | stable    | Any other value draws the radio.                    |

## Behavioral and layout contract

| FR1                   | Every current render contains a Trigger button. Pointer presentation renders a Pointer menu surface with pointer-owned rows and optional pointer headings, dividers, indicators, and nested flyouts. Touch presentation renders a Touch sheet frame containing a Touch menu surface, Touch heading, Touch action list, and Touch action rows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Current source, docs, and tests                                                                                                                                               | Verified current behavior; no new behavior decided                                |

The default `radio` draws the radio circle on every row. `ContextMenuRadioGroup` and `BreadcrumbMenuRadioGroup` are the same component.                                                                                                                                                   | DEC-8; `component:CheckIndicator` leaves row placement to its host; Selector's `indicatorPosition` defaults to `end`                                                          | Accepted; verified in jsdom and Chromium                                          |

### Allowed variation

- **AV1 — Presentation.** `popover`, `bottom-sheet`, and resolved `adaptive`
  presentation may select the current pointer or touch anatomy without changing
  the ownership of either branch.
- **AV2 — Content mode.** Data-driven and compound pointer menus may vary their
  rows while preserving the current target owners. Touch presentation remains
  data-driven.
- **AV3 — Optional content.** Icons, selectable indicators, headings, dividers,
  and nested actions render only when the supplied menu content requires them.

### Representative states

| State                       | Required invariant                                                                                                              | Allowed variation                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Anchored root menu          | Trigger button and Pointer menu surface render with pointer-owned rows.                                                         | Width, placement, alignment, and optional item content vary.     |
| Anchored nested flyout      | Pointer action row opens another Pointer menu surface and may show the submenu indicator icon.                                  | Loading may replace the indicator with the current Spinner.      |
| Bottom-sheet root actions   | Trigger button opens Touch sheet frame, Touch menu surface, heading, action list, and action rows.                              | Icons, sections, dividers, and action descriptions may vary.     |
| Bottom-sheet nested actions | The same frame and list owners remain while heading and rows change to the selected action level.                               | Back control and drill-in indicator follow current navigation.   |
| Selectable pointer action   | Pointer action row may contain shared checkbox or radio chrome.                                                                 | Checked and disabled state follow the current item contracts.    |
| Custom-trigger menu         | The caller's control carries the trigger ARIA and names the menu; the Pointer menu surface is unchanged.                        | Any focusable control: icon button, chip, avatar, list row.      |
| Link row                    | The Pointer action row (or Touch action row) is the anchor; `onClick`, close and navigation run in that order on a plain click. | `target`, `rel`, icon, description and destructive variant vary. |

### Transformation and precedence order

- **ORD2 — Link row activation.** modified click → the browser alone; else
  `onClick` → close (`hasCloseOnSelect`) → the browser navigates.
  | Drilled-in sub-menu | The Pointer menu surface shows a Back row then the sub-menu's rows; the parent rows are hidden, not unmounted. | Depth; which pointer opened the menu; a forced `presentation`. |
- No other presentation-resolution, open-state, positioning, or styling
  precedence rule is introduced.

### Performance and resources

- No new loading, listener, measurement, or render constraint is introduced.

## Accessibility contract

This draft does not change DropdownMenu's trigger naming, menu and dialog
roles, keyboard navigation, item semantics, or dismissal ordering. While a
pointer is held, the highlight is DOM focus per
`module:DropdownMenu/useMenuPress` AR1. Focus return on close follows FR6 and
`architecture:interaction-modality` INV1 through the shared focus-return
visibility helper.

- **AR1 — A custom trigger still names the menu.** With `trigger`, the menu
  carries `aria-labelledby` pointing at the control's `id` (the Button path
  keeps `aria-label`), and the control carries `aria-haspopup="menu"`,
  `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls`.

The `dropdown-menu` target intentionally appears on both alternative menu
surfaces. The radio element also carries Indicator's shared radio target, and
the pointer divider also carries Divider's target; their local targets remain
valid distinct contracts. Touch headings retain the shared `heading` target documented by Text rather
than adding a DropdownMenu-owned heading target.

## Family and system relationships

- `architecture:component-theming-surface` owns anatomy qualification, local
  target mapping, presentation-specific rows, and delegation rules.
- `architecture:interaction-modality` owns the shared pointer, touch, keyboard,
  and adaptive-presentation boundaries; this draft changes none of them.
- `architecture:layer-runtime` owns the current `usePopover` host, native
  light-dismiss reconciliation, anchor positioning, and nested `useLayer`
  flyouts. Touch presentation delegates hosting to BottomSheet.
- `family:overlay-dismissal` owns shared Escape and platform-close ordering.
  DropdownMenu root participates through its Popover focus trap; the composed
  BottomSheet and DropdownMenuSubMenu retain their recorded local-only adoption
  gaps.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — Pointer dismissal returns focus to the trigger, ring suppressed

**Reference:** `component:DropdownMenu/DEC-1`

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, 2026-10-02

The shipped behavior blurred the trigger after a pointer dismissal so Safari
would not paint a ring after a touch pick. Focus falling to the page loses a
keyboard user who reaches for the arrows next. Focus now returns to the
trigger and the shared focus-return visibility helper suppresses the ring
after pointer input (`architecture:interaction-modality` INV1), as the
bottom-sheet presentation already did. The press model's own decisions remain
in `module:DropdownMenu/useMenuPress`.

### DEC-2 — `menuMaxHeight` is a number of pixels

### DEC-3 — Any control can open a menu

**Reference:** `component:DropdownMenu/DEC-3`

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, 2026-10-02

`renderTrigger` is a render prop handing the caller `DropdownMenuTriggerProps`
to spread, so the press model, the keyboard opens and the ARIA wiring ride the
same code path as the built-in Button, and the menu is named by the control
through `aria-labelledby`. `button` and `renderTrigger` are mutually exclusive
(a dev warning); the Button path is unchanged.

The prop is named for `spec:AST-055` DEC-5 and DEC-6: `render<X>` is the
prefix for every render prop in the system, and a bare `trigger` is already
public with a different shape on `Collapsible`, where it is a `ReactNode`
slot, so one word would otherwise mean two things.

Rejected: a content slot taking a rendered element. A slot cannot hand the
caller the props the control must carry, so the component would have to
reach into the element to attach them.

The open state reaches the caller's control as `aria-expanded` on the spread
props, and the prop's documentation shows styling from that attribute. A
pressed look keyed to `:active` is not a substitute: `:active` does not
behave the same under a coarse pointer, which is why menu rows drop
coarse-pointer `:active` paint entirely.

Rejected: an `as` prop on the Button — an icon button, a chip, an avatar and a
list row are not Button variants; a slot component — hides which props must
reach the control.

### DEC-4 — Sub-menus drill in on a phone

**Reference:** `component:DropdownMenu/DEC-4`

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, 2026-10-02

A flyout beside a phone-width menu has no room. When a compact touch display
opened the menu — sampled once, as it opens, so the menu never changes shape
under a pointer — a sub-menu row pushes its view onto a stack the root keeps
(`useMenuDrillIn`, internal) and the root shows that view in place of its rows:
a "Back to <parent>" row, then the sub-menu's rows, inside the same menu box.
The sub-menu portals its list into the root's host so the row stays mounted,
its rows stay live, and Back has something to return focus to; sibling rows
and dividers need no knowledge of it. Works in compound and data mode and in
`ContextMenu`; `presentation` overrides the policy.

The query is `COMPACT_TOUCH_PRESENTATION_QUERY`, the one the root
presentation already uses to decide its bottom sheet, so one component
carries one meaning of "adaptive". A bare `(pointer: coarse)` disagreed with
it on a large touch tablet: the menu stayed an anchored popover while its
sub-menus replaced rows in place, a combination nobody designed.

The public surface is `presentation` alone. `useMenuDrillIn` and its
`DropdownMenuDrillIn` view-stack controller stay internal: exporting them
would make internal machinery permanent API that nothing here requires a
caller to touch. A product that later needs to drive the stack earns a
deliberate component or hook then, with its own contract.

Rejected: a flipped flyout — lands over the parent rows and reads as a second
menu; drill-in in data mode only — every menu in the app is compound; a
`{label, children}` snapshot pushed onto the stack — unmounts the row and
breaks focus return.

### DEC-5 — A row that goes somewhere is a link

**Reference:** `component:DropdownMenu/DEC-5`

**Decider:** vjeux, 2026-09-27 (owner confirmation pending)

A menu row whose act is navigation renders as the anchor itself, not a row with
an anchor inside, so a ⌘-click, Ctrl-click or middle click keeps the browser's
meaning and `LinkProvider` routes it; `onClick` runs before navigation on a
plain click and is skipped for a modified one, which the browser owns. The menu
still closes on a modified click — the row acted. Keyboard activation
synthesizes a click carrying the key's modifiers so ⌘-Enter opens a tab.

Rejected: an `onClick` that calls `navigate()` — loses new-tab, middle-click
and the router's prefetch; an inner anchor — two controls in one row.

### DEC-6 — A titled group of rows is `DropdownMenuGroup`

**Reference:** `component:DropdownMenu/DEC-6`

**Decider:** `cixzhang`, 2026-10-03

Data mode could title a run of rows through `{type: 'section', title}` and
compound mode could not, so the menus that most need grouping — checkbox
rows, radio groups, rows mounted conditionally, all of which must be
compound — left a screen reader a run of loose rows where a sighted user saw
two clusters. The compound peer names its rows through `aria-labelledby` on
the visible heading and reuses the `dropdown-menu-section-heading` treatment,
so one heading looks and reads the same in both modes.

The component is named for the `role="group"` it renders. The data model
keeps `DropdownMenuSection` for its `{type: 'section'}` entry: the two words
describe the same concept, and one name across both would collide with that
exported type. Rejected: renaming the component to `DropdownMenuSection`,
which collides; renaming both, which breaks a public type for a wording
change.

`title` is `ReactNode`. A rich heading is a legitimate need, and the data
mode's string title is the narrower case rather than the model to match. A
focusable node inside a heading lands in the group but outside the roving
focus order, so the arrow keys cannot reach it; the type does not prevent
that and a case pins the behavior instead.

### DEC-7 — A safe triangle protects the diagonal to a flyout

**Reference:** `component:DropdownMenu/DEC-7`
**Decider:** `cixzhang`, `2026-10-02`

`menuMaxHeight` replaces only the 300px term of the cap; the viewport gutters
still bound the menu, so a menu that must show all of its rows (a docked phone
menu of eleven 44px rows) can, without ever overflowing the screen. The dynamic
value uses `100dvb` alone; every browser with anchor positioning has it.

A prop rather than a theme variable, because the need is situational — one
menu with many rows — rather than a product-wide preference, and a prop reads
more clearly at the callsite that has the problem.

The value is a number of pixels. Rejected: an arbitrary CSS length (`50vh`,
`calc(...)`), which is product-shaped tuning on a shared component that
`spec:AST-002` does not admit, and which lets a caller write a cap the
viewport term cannot reason about.

### DEC-8 — A radio group chooses its mark: the radio circle or the check

**Reference:** `component:DropdownMenu/DEC-8`
**Decider:** `vjeux`, `2026-10-10`

A single choice in a menu reads either as a set of radios or as a list with the
current option checked, the way Selector and a native pop-up menu mark it. The
rows mean the same either way (`menuitemradio` with `aria-checked`), so the
choice is a picture, and both pictures already exist in the single-selection
indicator family: `radio` and `check`. The group chooses, so one set never mixes
marks. The check sits at the inline end, Selector's default edge, so the
unmarked rows' labels line up with the marked one. Every row renders the
indicator in its own state, as Selector's options do: the default check draws
nothing on an unchosen row, and a theme that replaces `check` with a mark that
draws an unchecked state shows that mark on every row.

Rejected: a per-row prop, which lets one set mix marks; remapping
`indicators.radio` in the theme, which changes every radio in the product,
RadioList included; and letting a `DropdownMenuItem` take
`role="menuitemradio"`, which hands the row's role, `aria-checked` and
selection to the caller.
