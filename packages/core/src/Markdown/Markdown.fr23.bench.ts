 * @file Markdown.fr23.bench.ts
 * @input The AST-036 fixture document and the representative helper set
 * @output One JSON line of FR23 ratios on stdout, for the harness that spawns it
 * @position Benchmark body for Markdown.fr23.perf.test.ts; not a test itself
 *
 * Run as its own process, one measurement at a time, by
 * `Markdown.fr23.perf.test.ts`. Nothing else may execute here: the ratio is
 * sensitive both to other work competing for the machine and to engine state
 * left behind by other plugin configurations in the same process, and this
 * file exists so neither can reach it.
 *
 * The timed region is exactly the spec's protocol — ten untimed warmups,
 * then nine alternating paired rounds averaging 20 iterations a side,
 * reported as the median of the nine paired ratios — against the omitted
 * baseline, for a stable list and a recreated equivalent one.
 *
 * That protocol is run under a validity gate. A paired design cancels a
 * machine that is uniformly slow, but not one that deschedules the two
 * sides unequally, and this process can still be sharing cores with the
 * test runner that spawned it. So each attempt also records how much the
 * BASELINE's own per-round time moved: when the same work varies by more
 * than a few percent across the attempt, the machine was not holding still
 * and the attempt is discarded and retried, not averaged in. The accepted
 * figure is one untouched run of the spec's statistic; only invalid
 * attempts are dropped, and exhausting them fails loudly.
